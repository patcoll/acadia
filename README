Acadia
======

CMS framework built on the Django platform.

TO INSTALL
----------

To install under a virtualenv:

    # Step 0. Create your virtualenv. (virtualenvwrapper highly recommended)
    mkvirtualenv acadia
    cdvirtualenv
    easy_install -a --prefix . pip
    pip install -r /path/to/acadia/requirements.txt

Then, while still "in" the virtualenv, run Acadia with the built-in Django web server:

    # both "acadia"s are necessary to get into the python module dir
    cd /path/to/acadia/acadia
    python manage.py runserver
